This is the actual OrchiveApp

Beginning Phase 1

6/16/11:  Created databases for posts, comments, and tags
          Current Status: One can post and comment on a post (tagging doesn't 
          work)

          A post consists of a name (user), title, content, user location 
          (determined by us), post location [where event is occuring] 
          (determined by user), date and time, accuracy and inaccuracy

          One may edit, delete, and show a post
          Showing a post shows details of the post and any comments or tags
          
          A comment consists of a name (commenter) and content
          One may only delete a comment (not edit)

6/18/11:  Made Header (Logo + Navigation Bar) and Footer (Copy, Translation
          [Not Working] and Bottom Links)

          Created skeletons for the static pages (About, Contact, Privacy, 
          Terms). A skeleton is a placeholder page.

          Currently No CSS (Will add in the future)

          Next... Finish static pages
          Then... Either add CSS or build News Feed, Home Page, etc.
