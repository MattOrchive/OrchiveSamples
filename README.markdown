This is the actual OrchiveApp

Beginning Phase 1

6/16/11:  Created databases for posts, comments, and tags
          Current Status: One can post and comment on a post (tagging doesn't work)

          A post consists of a name (user), title, content, user location (determined by us), post location [where event is occuring] (determined by user), date and time, accuracy and inaccuracy

          One may edit, delete, and show a post
          Showing a post shows details of the post and any comments or tags
          
          A comment consists of a name (commenter) and content
          One may only delete a comment (not edit)
